# SNGR_Automation
Updates to the SNGR automation Script
Noteable changes inlcude:
Cases run not done in permutation way, but in build from lowest range way
Check on user inputs implemented
Some cleanup should be done...
In the end, I do prefer regex subs over string replaces, as it is easier
to replace a protion of an entire regex.
